🌈 What’s This All About? 🌟
Hey there, party people! 🎈 Welcome to Joseph Onyango’s Portfolio Website—the grooviest spot on the web! I’m a software engineer and web developer who loves making things that sparkle ✨, solve problems, and make you go “WOWZA!” 😍 This site is my playground, packed with cool stuff like projects, skills, and even some fancy tools to play with. Oh, and did I mention the snowflakes ❄️ that follow your mouse like little hugs? Or the glowing particles 🌠 that make every page feel like a disco? 🕺 Let’s dive in!

🚀 How to Join the Party? (Setup Instructions) 🎈

Grab the Goodies!Snag the files by cloning the repo or downloading them—your choice!  
git clone <repository-url>

Or just click that download button like a pro! 💾

Throw a Web Party!This is a static site, so you could just open index.html in your browser, but let’s do it right with a local server! Use something like VS Code’s Live Server or spin up a quick one:  
python -m http.server 8000

Then hop over to http://localhost:8000 and let the fun begin! 🎉

Don’t Forget the Bling!We’re using Font Awesome for icons, and it’s loaded via CDN:  
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.2/css/all.min.css">

Make sure you’re online so the icons can join the party—or host them locally if you’re feeling extra! 🌐

Language Magic!The translations.js file is like a mystery box—it’s not here! 🕵️ You’ll need to whip one up and add the applyTranslations function to make the language dropdown work. Something like:  
function applyTranslations(lang) {
    // Add your translation magic here! ✨
}




🕹️ How to Play? (Usage) 🎲

Explore Like an Adventurer! Use the navigation bar at the top to hop between pages—Home, About, Services, Skills, Projects, Tools, and Contact! 🗺️  
Switch Languages! Pick your fave language from the dropdown (English, Spanish, French)—but only if you’ve got that translations.js ready! 🌍  
Chase Snowflakes! Wiggle your mouse around to see snowflakes follow you like little fans! ❄️  
Watch the Disco Lights! Those glowing particles are dancing on every page—don’t they make you wanna boogie? 🕺  
Play with Tools! Head to the Tools page (tools.html) and try out all the fun gadgets—calculate stuff, pick colors, or time your dance moves! ⏱️🎨


🧸 What’s in the Toy Box? (Tools Details) 🎁

🧮 Scientific Calculator: Add, subtract, or get fancy with sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, and powers!  
☀️ Weather App: Fake weather forecasts for any city (e.g., "Nairobi: 25°C, Sunny")—it’s all pretend, but so fun!  
📋 To-Do List: Add tasks, delete them, and feel super productive!  
💸 Currency Converter: Swap between USD, EUR, KES, and GBP with mock rates—money magic!  
⏱️ Timer/Stopwatch: Time your dance-offs with a stopwatch or set a countdown for a quick nap!  
📏 Unit Converter: Convert length (meters, miles), weight (kg, pounds), or temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit)—so handy!  
🎲 Random Number Generator: Pick a random number for your next game of chance!  
🎨 Color Picker: Choose a color, see its HEX and RGB, and watch it light up!  
🏋️ BMI Calculator: Pop in your weight and height to see your BMI—health vibes!


🤔 Oopsie-Daisies! (Known Issues) 🚧

Language Switcheroo: The translations.js file is playing hide-and-seek—it’s not here! You’ll need to make it, or the language dropdown will throw a tantrum. 😤  
Weather App: It’s just pretending with mock data—no real weather here! Want the real deal? Add a weather API like OpenWeatherMap! 🌦️  
Icons Need Love: Font Awesome icons need the internet to show up. If you’re offline, they’ll ghost you! 👻


🌟 Dream Big! (Future Improvements) 🚀

Add real weather forecasts with a shiny API! 🌞  
Make the Contact page a real chatterbox with a working form! 📬  
Turn up the disco vibes with more particle tricks—faster, brighter, wilder! 🌠  
Add more toys to the Tools page or make the current ones even cooler (like saving your to-do list for later)! 🕹️
